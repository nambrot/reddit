# Intro to Rails

This is the reddit clone as built in my Intro to Rails Session. Check this repository out if you want to replay what we did. I tried my best in having small understandable steps in the form of commits and also check out my comments in the commits. Also, I would appreciate if you comment on these commits as well.

### Setup

The only requirement to run this project is to have Rails installed. Check [http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html) for more details. Alternatively, use [nitrous.io](http://www.nitrous.io)
