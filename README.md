# Intro to Rails

This is the reddit clone as built in my Intro to Rails Session. Check this repository out if you want to replay what we did. I tried my best in having small understandable steps in the form of [commits](https://github.com/nambrot/reddit/commits/) and also check out my comments in the commits. Also, I would appreciate if you comment on these commits as well. I will also answer any question who might have here.

### Setup

The only requirement to run this project is to have Rails installed. Check [http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html) for more details. Alternatively, use [nitrous.io](http://www.nitrous.io)

### Possible Extensions

When you have finished this excercise, but you don't wanna stop yet, consider implementing the following features:

- Karma Voting
- Subreddits
- Messaging System

### Questions

Once again, if you have any questions, just comment on any commit or file or send me an email at nam@nambrot.com
